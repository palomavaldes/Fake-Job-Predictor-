# Fake Job Predictor
This Python machine learning model predict whether a job posting is fake or not. I used the data set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amruthjithrajvr/recruitment-scam to train my model.

# Problem
College students and early career graduates search the job market for opportunities but unfortunately come across fraudulent job postings (via social media platforms, advertisements, job sites, and electronic communication) that present as legitimate. Although they the scammer job posts seem real, they have the ill intention of taking the personal information and perhaps money from innocent job seekers.
